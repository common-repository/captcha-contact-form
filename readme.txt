Contact form with Google reCaptcha V.2 Capabilities and SMTP integration

== Long Description == 

This plugin was developed for those who need to use the Google reCaptcha system as part of their website's contact form.
The plugin also enables SMTP for wp_mail, and uses user defined email settings. I developed this plugin for my own personal use. 

1) To add the contact form to your website, insert the shortcode [contactForm]
2) To edit the email configuration and Google Captcha settings, go to WP_ADMIN, and click the menu item 'Captcha Contact Form'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the form use Google Captcha v.3 or v.2 =

It uses v.2

= What mailing system does the plugin use? =

This plugin enables and uses phpmailer.
